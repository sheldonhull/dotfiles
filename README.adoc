= dotfiles

== Overview

Configuration for:

* visual-studio-codespaces

Originally this was built off chezmoi with a a private repo, but it requires every single codespace to have a secondary bootstrap phase.
This will be a simplified migration from the large chezmoi project I have with the primary focus first of working with devcontainer/Codespaces oriented workflow in Linux.

== Use
